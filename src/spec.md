## Summary
**Goal:** Update the hero background image and adjust the color theme to match the new image.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the Hero component background with the uploaded WhatsApp Image 2026-02-22 at 11.34.16 AM (1)-1.jpeg
- Update the application color theme to complement the new image, using colors from its palette (steel blues, burgundy reds, dusty pinks, charcoal grays, warm skin tones)
- Place the image in frontend/public/assets/generated and reference it correctly in the Hero component

**User-visible outcome:** The portfolio will display the new hero background image with a cohesive color scheme throughout the application that harmonizes with the image's palette.
