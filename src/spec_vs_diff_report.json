The backend (main.mo) correctly stores phone number '7997411133' and email 'thanishaivana004@gmail.com' in the ContactInfo type, satisfying REQ-16. However, there is no evidence of changes to the ContactSection component (frontend/src/components/ContactSection.tsx) to display this information, leaving REQ-15 unimplemented.",
